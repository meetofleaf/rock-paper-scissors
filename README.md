# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Python 3
This repository contains a command-line implementation of the popular game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" programmed in Python 3. The game allows two human players to play against each other by selecting one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors.

### Game Play
To start playing, simply run the rock_paper_scissors.py file and follow the instructions on the command line. The game is played turn by turn, with each player making a selection. A function then compares the two selections and determines the winner. A score function keeps track of the number of wins, losses, and ties, and displays the summary at the end of the game.

### How to Play
During the game, players can make their selection by entering the corresponding number (1 for rock, 2 for paper, 3 for scissors) on the command line. The game will then display the winner of each turn, as well as the current score. To quit the game, players can enter 'q' or 'quit' when prompted.

### Suggestions and Improvements
This project is open to suggestions and improvements. If you have any feedback or ideas to enhance the game, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue in the repository.

Thank you for playing!
