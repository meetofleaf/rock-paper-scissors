# rock-paper-scissors
Rock-paper-scissors programmed in Python 3.

An old Command-line game I programmed, where 2 human players play choose 1 out of Rock, Paper, Scissors turn by turn.
Then a function compares the selection and decides who wins.
A score function keeps score of wins, loses and ties; and is displayed when the players quit.

You can play it by using number keys above the alphabet keys and numpad keys, cover your selection with the other hand so the other player doesn't cheat.
Then when you quit, you'll get a summary of scores of both the players.

Suggestions & Improvements are much appreciated.

Thank You!
